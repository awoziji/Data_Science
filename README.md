# Data Science Portfolio

Here we have a growing collection of work I've done in the area of data science. The first works that will be loaded here are focused on data cleaning and visualization rather than machine learning.

The first project I have added is an analysis on CEO compensation and can be found [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kaumaron/Data_Science/blob/master/CEO_Compensation/CEO_Compensation.ipynb). Currently, I'm having trouble getting Jupyter notebooks to render in GitHub, so that link takes you to nbviewer. The project itself is located in the CEO_Compensation folder.
